# Mythic Market Litepaper
*A Community-Driven Platform for Micro Meme Coin Collectibles on Solana*

---

## 1. Introduction
Mythic Market is a community-driven platform featuring low-supply micro meme coin collectibles on Solana, each inspired by mythical gods and launched through transparent community voting.  
We blend scarcity and fair-launch principles to create truly collectible tokens that reward early believers and foster genuine market-driven price discovery.

## 2. Vision & Mission

**Vision:**  
Restore trust and integrity to crypto collectibles by ensuring fairness, transparency, and community governance.

**Mission:**  
Launch a series of 5,000-supply tokens with locked liquidity, no private allocations, and ongoing buybacks and burns, empowering holders and building long-term value.

## 3. Core Principles

- Complete Openness: All launch details are public and verifiable. No secret allocations, presales, or insider privileges.
- Equal Opportunity: Everyone participates on a level playing field; no reserved shares for teams, VCs, or early backers.
- Market-Led Value: Prices emerge exclusively from real supply and demand, free from manipulation or artificial pumping.
- Locked Liquidity: Secured LP prevents rug pulls and safeguards community interests.
- Designed Scarcity: Fixed supply of 5,000 tokens per collectible promotes rarity and sustainable value.
- Community First: Governance and future direction are driven by collective engagement and market feedback.

## 4. How Mythic Market Works

1. **Token Creation:** Each token contract is deployed with exactly 5,000 total supply and metadata pointing to its mythic theme.
2. **Dual Liquidity Pools:** Tokens are paired in either SOL-only or SOL/USDC dual pools via Meteora Dynamic AMM depending on strategy.
3. **Fair Launch:** At a predetermined UTC time set on Meteora, liquidity is added and unlocked for trading immediately on chain. Buyers purchase at market price, no pre-sales or whitelists.
4. **Post-Launch Mechanics:**
   - Locked LP: Liquidity remains locked for a transparent duration. Once we grow liquidity will be locked for 1 year minimum, eventually permanently. No liquidity will ever be withdrawn.
   - Buybacks & Burns: Announced buyback programs consume trading fees to burn tokens, enhancing scarcity.
5. **Community Voting:** Prior to each launch, token themes (e.g., Zeus, Thor) are chosen by the community via polls, eventually voting integrated on Mythic Market website.
